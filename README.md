# Analysis of Influencer Reach for Product Promotion

## Task Overview

This repository contains the analysis and results of a project aimed at selecting the optimal influencers for promoting a new product.

### Data File

The analysis is based on the data provided in the file `influencers.csv`.

### Project Description

The company is considering collaborating with 10 gummy-bloggers (influencers) to promote its new product. The attached file presents the results of a survey in which 1,000 respondents answered if they had seen an advertisement for another product, on the social media of the 10 analyzed influencers. Each respondent could have seen the advertisement from 0 to all 10 influencers. Unfortunately, the current budget allows advertising with only 5 out of the 10 bloggers.

### Objectives

Based on the survey data, the project aims to analyze:
1. The individual reach of each influencer.
2. The combined reach of specific subgroups of influencers (e.g., groups of 2, 3 influencers).
3. The optimal selection of 5 influencers to maximize the campaign's reach.

### Analysis and Deliverables

The analysis includes:
- Data exploration to understand the dataset and identify any missing values, outliers, or incorrect encoding.
- Calculation of the reach for each individual influencer.
- Determination of the total reach for selected subgroups of influencers.
- Recommendations for selecting the optimal 5 influencers to maximize the campaign's reach.
- Additional recommendations for scenarios where a specific influencer must be included among a smaller group of 3 influencers.

### Visualizations and Recommendations

The results of the analysis are presented with visualizations and business recommendations to aid in decision-making for the campaign strategy.
